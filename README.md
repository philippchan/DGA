## Abstract

Insulation oil plays a critical role in transformers, serving to insulate and cool the system. DGA is a valuable diagnostic tool used to monitor transformer health by analysing gases dissolved in the oil. However, its practical application is hindered by the lack of universal standards, resulting in varied interpretations and implementations across different contexts. Many scholars have turned to ML techniques to enhance DGA's effectiveness and developed diverse approaches to predict transformer faults. However, a common trend in existing literature is the emphasis on model development over methodological rigour. Issues such as dataset imbalance, appropriate evaluation metrics, and thorough testing and validation procedures are often overlooked. 

This study fills this gap by providing a critical and detailed review of the methodological steps in DGA through ML models. We justify our design considerations and enhance the robustness of the models by utilizing data from a Hong Kong-based company. Python and `scikit-learn` are used in experimenting the models due to their versatility, scalability, and ease of prototyping. The source code of the project is published on the author's GitHub repository so as to facilitate further advancements in DGA research and open science.
